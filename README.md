# GameWizard
**Whoosh** is a personal assistant that, through a message-based query, can recommend you games based on interest or similar games that you tell them. This whole process is made possible thanks to a Machine Learning model that checks a database of games and returns the most compatible with your taste.
Currently the game suggestion is based on a not updated version of the Twitch's IGDB database.

The assistant is currently able to understand:
 - Greetings messages;
 - Name requests;
 - Salutes messages;
 - Game request messages;
